## DeathAnimation Plugin

**DeathAnimation** is an advanced plugin for **Minecraft** that adds custom animations and sound effects triggered when a player dies. This plugin utilizes a resource pack to display the animation and play a sound when a player dies in the game. Additionally, the plugin allows executing custom commands when a player dies.

### Main Features:

- **Custom Animations:** Displays a text animation to all players when another player dies. The frames for the animation are dynamically generated from Unicode codes.
- **Custom Sounds:** Plays a sound for all players connected when a player dies, with adjustable volume and pitch settings.
- **Custom Commands:** Executes a list of commands when a player dies. The commands can include the `title` command to show a message to the player with a configurable delay.

### Configuration:

The plugin's parameters can be adjusted through the `config.yml` file. Some configurable parameters include:

- **Animation:** Enable or disable the animation.
- **Animation Speed:** Adjust the speed of the animation frames in ticks.
- **Sound:** Enable or disable the sound and adjust its volume and pitch.
- **Commands:** Specify a list of commands to execute upon player death, including support for the `title` command.

### How to Install:

1. Place the `.jar` file into your Minecraft server's `plugins` folder.
2. Configure the plugin according to your preferences in the `config.yml` file.
3. Restart or reload the server to activate the plugin.

### Example Configuration (`config.yml`):

  ```yaml
animacion: true          # Whether the animation is enabled or not 
unicode_inicial: '\uE000' # Initial Unicode for the animation frames 
numero_de_fotogramas: 92  # Total number of animation frames 
velocidad_animacion: 1   # Animation speed in ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second 

# Commands that will be executed during the animation 
comandos:
  - 'title @a actionbar {"text":"{player} ha muerto","color":"red"}'

# Sound configuration 
sonido:
  activar: true            # Enable/disable custom sound 
  volumen: 1.0              # Sound volume (from 0.0 to 1.0) 
  pitch: 1.0                # Sound pitch (from 0.5 to 2.0) 

# Wait time for the 'title' command (in ticks) 
title_wait: 40 # 20 ticks by default, which is 1 second 
```
## Texture Pack Setup

The **DeathAnimation** plugin relies on a **resource pack** to display the custom animation on the player's screen when they die. This animation is composed of Unicode characters, and the frames of the animation must be configured in the **font file** of the resource pack.

### How the Plugin Works with the Resource Pack:

- Upon installation and activation of the plugin on your server, the plugin will output a list of generated **Unicode characters** to the console. These Unicode characters are used to create the frames of the animation.

- The number of frames generated will depend on your configuration in the `config.yml` file (specifically the **number_of_frames** parameter).

- These Unicode characters must be added to the **default.json** file of your resource pack's font configuration, in order to link the characters with actual images for the animation.

### Example Unicode Frame Configuration in `default.json`:

Each Unicode character corresponds to a frame, and the characters need to be added to the `chars` list in the **font** section of your resource pack. Here is an example of how you might configure 3 frames in the `default.json`:

   ```yaml 
  [
    {
      "type": "bitmap",
      "file": "minecraft:0090.png",
      "ascent": 30,
      "height": 40,
      "chars": ["\uE059"]  
    },
    {
      "type": "bitmap",
      "file": "minecraft:0091.png",
      "ascent": 30,
      "height": 40,
      "chars": ["\uE05A"]  
    },
    {
      "type": "bitmap",
      "file": "minecraft:0092.png",
      "ascent": 30,
      "height": 40,
      "chars": ["\uE05B"]  
    }
  ]
